# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

Made with my mentor [Joost Baaij](https://github.com/tilsammans) at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

[Production Demo](http://r3trobloccit.herokuapp.com)

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
